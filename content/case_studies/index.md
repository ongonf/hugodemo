The situation:

Prices in Crown Court Legal Aid work had been undergoing a sustained increase. Several drivers were identified that suggested that these increases would continue, such as:
Increased electronic evidence

Media focus on collapse of trials due to lack of evidence
New guidance on the disclosure of data
However, there was no information to determine for how long these increases could continue. In addition, prices had risen particularly quickly in more recent months and may be an indication of an accelerating trend.
