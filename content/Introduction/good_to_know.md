There is a difference between uncertainty and risk; risk typically refers to the likelihood of a future unplanned event or unintended consequence that can be assigned a numeric probability. Forecasts of risk, like other forecasts, are themselves subject to uncertainty. For example, UK Met Office predictions of the risk of rain are uncertain as to whether it will rain at all, as well as uncertainty about how much it will rain. This uncertainty is described using a range from running several forecasts from equally likely initial conditions.
