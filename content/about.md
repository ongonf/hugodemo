Testing!!! Mock!!!

A cross government group has worked together to create an assessing and communicating uncertainty toolkit.

This toolkit sets out good, not best, practice, as analysis and communication must always be tailored to the audience and decision being made.

The toolkit is presented in the first instance as a suggested set of guidelines and we will be consulting with experts from Government, the academic community and other external bodies to develop thinking in line with the latest evidence on communicating uncertainty.
